Binary Tree
==============
Insertion complexity
----------------------
Avg Case O(log n)
This is for balanced tree

Worst Case O(n)
Worst case happens of on unbalanced tree where a tree starts behaving like a linked list

Tree Traversal
===============

Complexity O(n)

Pre Order
---------
Node is visited before its children
Usage to create copy of the tree

In Order
---------
Left child is visited before the node and then right child
Usage take action on sorted order

Post Order
-----------
Left and right children are visited before the node
Usage delete children first and then the node
